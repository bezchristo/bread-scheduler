# Bread Scheduler

I was tired of most recipe websites, which just list a bunch of ingredients and steps but provide few tools for actually helping plan your bake. Since "slow bread" requires a good deal of planning, I created a couple tools to help the process.

## Features

1. The Bread Scheduler: a timeline tool that lets users customize start and end times for each steps

2. Built-in timers: Timers for each step along the way

3. Unit conversions: Easily flip between ounces and grams

4. Simple "halving": Cut the recipe in half with one click

5. Nice photos: All photos were taken by me

## Starting the project

1. Download and install MongoDB (see [instructions here](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-mongoose-for-mongodb-and-nodejs--cms-29527))

2. Clone this repo

3. Run `mongod` to start Mongo

4. `cd` into `client` folder and run `npm start`

5. `cd` into `server`  folder and run `npm start`

## Stack

This was really just a test case for technology I'm interested in learning. Namely, this runs on a MEVN stack, using Mongoose, Express, Vue.js and Node.

This is the second app I've now built using this stack. It was lots of fun and helped me learn a lot about full-stack development.

## Thanks

I have a number of tutorials and sites to thank. I used Lynda to get up to speed on MEVN very quickly. I must also thank Aneeta Sharma (get.aneeta@gmail.com), whose MEVN template was the basis for this project.
